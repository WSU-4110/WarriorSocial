# Sprint 1 Planning Report
In our first Sprint, our group will focus on getting our UI for our application working before functionality. Getting tabs to work, sorting out navigation, etc. We tasked out 6 functional requirements to Chloe (Front-End), Sherin (Front-End), and Samia (“Full-Stack”) with the goal being the UI (design and layout).

- FR2 - User Login
- FR5 - Home Page
- FR6 - Calendar
- FR7 - Student Org Profiles
- FR9 - Discussion Forum
- FR11 - User Preferences/Settings

For this first Sprint, due to a lack of experience working with databases, our back-end team will focus on researching different database systems (MySQL vs Firebase vs SQLite) and decide on the best choice for our application.
